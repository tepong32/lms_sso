                    Here’s a breakdown of what each line does:

                    if self.status == 'approved':: This line checks if the status of the Leave instance is ‘approved’. The code inside this if block will only be executed if the leave is approved.

                    leave_counter, _ = LeaveCounter.objects.get_or_create(employee=self.employee): This line gets the LeaveCounter instance associated with the employee who took the leave. If no such LeaveCounter instance exists, it creates a new one.

                    leave_duration = self.end_date - self.start_date + timedelta(days=1): This line calculates the duration of the leave in days. It adds 1 to include both the start and end dates in the duration.

                    if orig.status == 'approved':: This line checks if the original status of the Leave instance (before it was updated) was ‘approved’. The code inside this if block will only be executed if the original leave was approved.

                    leave_counter.instances_used_this_year -= original_duration: If the original leave was approved, this line decreases the instances_used_this_year field of the LeaveCounter instance by the original duration of the leave.

                    leave_counter.instances_used_this_quarter -= original_duration: Similarly, this line decreases the instances_used_this_quarter field of the LeaveCounter instance by the original duration of the leave.

                    leave_counter.instances_used_this_year += leave_duration.days: This line increases the instances_used_this_year field of the LeaveCounter instance by the duration of the leave.

                    leave_counter.instances_used_this_quarter += leave_duration.days: Similarly, this line increases the instances_used_this_quarter field of the LeaveCounter instance by the duration of the leave.

                    leave_counter.save(): Finally, this line saves the LeaveCounter instance with the updated leave counts.

                    So, in summary, this block of code updates the LeaveCounter instance whenever a Leave instance is saved. If the leave is approved, it increases the leave counts by the duration of the leave. If the leave was previously approved but its status has changed, it decreases the leave counts by the original duration of the leave.
