Leaves already approved add counts to instances_used_this_year and instances_used_this_quarter. However, when changed back to Pending/Rejected, the counter does not subtract from both fields. 
	--- actually realized that this is a good FEATURE and should not be considered a BUG since "personal connection" to the TeamLeader can lead to illegal adjustments of leave credits.


IncreaseMaxInstances function/view added.
	--- might need to create separate adjustment fields for per_year and per_quarter adjustments.


Will need to work on carrying-over un-used allowed_instances_per_quarter to the next quarter/s.
