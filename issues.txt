Leaves already approved add counts to instances_used_this_year and instances_used_this_quarter. However, when changed back to Pending/Rejected, the counter does not subtract from both fields. 
	--- actually realized that this is a good FEATURE and should not be considered a BUG since "personal connection" to the TeamLeader can lead to illegal adjustments of leave credits.




Newly-registered accounts need to be inactive first. (requires admin-intervention to be able to login to the site)
Registration needs to include bio/profile details for admin convenience in allowing which accounts to approve.

DRF API views need to have urls using <staff_id> as opposed to currently used <pk>
	--- lookup_field="staff_id" gives an error saying
	"ImproperlyConfigured at /api/users/

	Could not resolve URL for hyperlinked relationship using view name "user-detail". You may have failed to include the related model in your API, or incorrectly configured the `lookup_field` attribute on this field."








dapat mai-loop yung instances(days) ng leave requests sa admin side UI para makapag approve/reject ng specific days
a function to turn range dates for leave applications to a for-loop (perhaps?) so, they can be approved/rejected individually

admin > groups >specific page for members of the leaveCounterAdjuster group




work on profile display on dashboard_links.html:
	displayed photo and name when in desktop view
	hide when in mobile
links to directly cancel leaves thru the home widgets (x) button



handle the message notif for auto-approve leaves or leave statuses in the view (formview yata?)
add display counts for allowed_leaves_per_day and remaining allowed_leaves_per_day
check cluster allocation (daily):
	pag meron + may ununsed_instances_per_quarter: auto-approved
	hindi na lang naiimplement yung >7days prior to target date





### USER

Upon user creation, leave_counters are not automatically assigned to users which leads to an error when that user tries to send a Leave request
	not sure if this is still the case as there's a method implemented on the model already. Just re-check.


### HOME

Might need to rename "employee" attr to "user" for universality. Do this kapag gagawa ka na ng bagong DB.

LeaveCounter.reset_counters() and carry-over() still unchecked if working properly due to server-time testing constraints
	reset_counters() not triggering was because it cannot be automatically set thru django. It needs to be a CRON JOB.
	Will need to work on carrying-over un-used allowed_instances_per_quarter to the next quarter/s.

LeaveCounter.carry_over(): for instances na mageexceed sa max_allowed_per_quarter ung allowed leaves, walang subtraction na mangyayari sa following-quarter
	yung adjustments ay maiimplement na lang sa end-of-year thru validation ng max_allowed_per_year.
	If this needs to change, code mods are needed. Kung wala namang issues or constraints, pwede nang hayaan.

LeaveCounter addition signal works, subtraction (upon leave cancellation or deletion) does not.
