notes:

home:
	separated views for auth'ed and unauth'ed users implemented (well, not really...yet)



	

users:
	set account identifier as staff_id
	working CRUD pages for users' profile info
	Marlon's custom user requirement partially met. :)

	to-dos:
	hierarchichal structure needs to be determined then implement is_staff status + restrictions
