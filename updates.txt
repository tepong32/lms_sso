		TIP!
		for future projects' password-change/reset things, see: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/auth/default/#module-django.contrib.auth.views

		then you can actually just go to "env/site-packages/django/contrib/auth/templates/registration/" to copy or modify the templates directly. No need to create new ones. LOL!

Duplicating working instances:
	Initial migration: OK
	Create superuser: OK
	Create WorkGroups and assign a Manager and allowed_leaves_per_day to each
		- these WorkGroups are needed for users sign-ups




Major Updates:
Leave.auto-approve() now working as intended. Conditions: Still has cluster allocated counts remaining and request filed is >7 days from filing date. :)
