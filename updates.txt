		for future projects' password-change/reset things, see: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/auth/default/#module-django.contrib.auth.views

Initial migration: OK
Create superuser: OK
Create Managers
Create WorkGroups and assign a Manager and allowed_leaves_per_day to each
	- these WorkGroups are needed for users sign-ups
Upon user creation, leave_counters are not automatically assigned to users which leads to an error when that user tries to send a Leave request
