how-to's:
	comment-out users.profile model +related imports on admin, signals, etc
	mm + m, csu, create default EmployeeType and/or WorkGroup instances
	mm +m, uncomment profile model and signals to enable auto-profile-creation on user registration

		TIP!
		for future projects' password-change/reset things, see: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/auth/default/#module-django.contrib.auth.views

		then you can actually just go to "env/site-packages/django/contrib/auth/templates/registration/" to copy or modify the templates directly (copying preferred. why? Think about it! ;)). No need to create new ones. LOL!

manually create accounts for TLs and OMs
	just create a filter of employees based on departments so they can view/approve/reject leave applications
	maybe I'll go with this approach instead of deep-layering model-linkings

create instances of TL's prior to creation of Advisors (for ForeignKey links)
	>superuser >OMs >TLs

for easier profile creations, options for Advisors' department, tl and om attributes will be hard-coded for now
	automatic-profile creation breaks when there are more than one ForeignKey linkings. idk what's wrong yet

comment-out the ff when creating a superuser for the first time:
	apps.py 		def ready(self):
	admin.py 		ProfileAdmin.emp_type
	models.py 		Profile.emp_type, Profile.workgroup





ERROR newly-created accounts not being able to submit leave requests.
	bing says it is because the leave_counter is being created before the user gets its ID
	work on signals
