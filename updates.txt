notes:

home:
	separated views for auth'ed and unauth'ed users implemented (well, not really...yet)



	

users:
	set account identifier as staff_id
	working CRUD pages for users' profile info
	Marlon's custom user requirement partially met. :)
	EmployeeClassification linked to Profile model successfully. Just remove/comment-out "classification" attr on Profile model prior to 1st migration, create the default instance of EmployeeClassification and then restore "classification" attr

	to-dos:
	hierarchichal structure needs to be determined then implement is_staff status + restrictions



how-to's:
	comment-out users.profile model +related imports on admin, signals, etc
	mm + m, csu, create default EmployeeType and/or WorkGroup instances
	mm +m, uncomment profile model and signals to enable auto-profile-creation on user registration
